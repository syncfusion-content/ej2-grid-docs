# Accessibility in ##Platform_Name## Grid control

The Grid component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Grid component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Grid component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Grid component:

## Ensuring accessibility

The Grid component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Grid component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/grid.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Grid component with accessibility tools.
